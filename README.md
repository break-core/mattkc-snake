# mattkc-snake
I got bored and rewatched one of MattKC's older videos (can you really believe 2020 was 5 years ago?) and noticed something. He made a snake game in a single HTML file, and not only that, the entire source code for it was shown on screen for a little bit.

With some frame-by-frame analysis, the source code was remade as accurately as possible, and now it lives here.
